# Cleaning
The manual references a couple of cleaning cycles.     The important thing to note is the machine rinses itself on startup and shutdown.  It can be handy to leave a cup under the dispenser as it is a fair bit of water that ends up in the drip tray.       The manual references doing a daily cleaning of the milk system using a milk system cleaning detergent.    Lots of these available for larger name brand machines.   The 3 min milk system cleaning essentially tells you to fill a container with the cleaning solution and insert the milk tube.  It then flushes milk system with the detergent.     It then tells you to replace with clean water.  It then flushes with clean water.   As a simple flush you can simply use water twice.    It flushes a fair bit of water, so prepare to use a full mug of water (twice) and a mug under the dispenser (that you will empty between the two phases).

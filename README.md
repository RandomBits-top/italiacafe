# Cleaning
## Startup and Shutdown
The machine runs a rinse cycle when it is turned on or off.   Consider keeping a cup under the dispenser spout.
## Milk System Cleaning
The 3 minute milk cleaning routine has two main phases:
1. Flush the system with detergent
2. Flush the system with clean water.

The manual references using a detergent but supplies no further detail.   Most of the brand name espresso machines with milk has some sort of detergent available at coffee retailers or amazon.    It is usally mixed with water.

If you you simply want to rinse the milk system simply fill your container with water.   I use two mug - one filled with water and one under the dispensing spout. Let it run through the detergent phase, then dump the waster water and refill the fresh water jug before hitting ok to run the clean water rinse.

# Programming and Adjustments
There are 6 user profiles.   Each recipe can be tweaked to your reference and the recipies are saved per user profile.  The details in the drinks list above are the default settings and give you an idea of the areas of available adjustment.
